  <h3>Delicious, Spicy, and Sticky Chicken Tenders Covered in a Honey Garlic Glaze</h3>
  <p>The secret to my Spicy Honey Garlic Chicken Tenders is the glaze. A perfect balance between sweet, savory, and spicy,
  making it super addicting. I love using Korean Chili Paste because it is packed with umami flavors. The honey balances
  out the saltiness, and the garlic provides an extra level of depth to the dish.</p>

  <p>I pan-fried the chicken tenders for this recipe, but you can also deep fry or air fry them. Using an egg as part of the
  batter helps hold on to the coating and prevent it from falling during the frying process. I also recommend using a
  non-stick pan if you are not adding alot of oil, as it will help prevent the coating from sticking.</p>
