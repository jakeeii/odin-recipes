  <h3>A Delicious Blend of Asian Flavours and Spices on BBQ Chicken</h3>
  <p>Think of this dish as Chicken Teriyaki with a South Asian flair, or India meets the other flavours of Asia. Seasoned with lime, ginger, soy sauce, and garam masala, this dish is sure to be a hit!</p>
  <p>Perfect for when you want to use the grill but elevate the usual cookout. The sugar in the glaze helps the chicken caramelize while it cooks on the grill.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dark Brown Sugar</li>
    <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Lime Juice</li>
    <li>Sesame Oil</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Garam Masala</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Ginger</li>
    <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
    <li>Scallions</li>
    <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together all of the ingredients except for the chicken and scallions. Set Â¼ cup of the marinade
    aside and cover (you'll use this later for the sauce), then place the rest in a zip-lock freezer bag with the chicken
    thighs. Be sure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade, then place the bag in the refrigerator (in a bowl in
    case of leakage); let marinate for 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat grill to high heat. Grease the grill.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken on the grill; cover and cook 3-5 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned and done. Transfer the
    chicken to a serving platter, then top with the reserved marinade and sliced scallions.</li>
  </ol>
